# E-commerce Database Management System

This project focuses on developing a robust database management system for E-commerce. The system efficiently handles user information, product listings, inventory management, order tracking, and transaction data.

## Project Focus

The E-commerce database system simplifies operations and improves user experience by managing:
- **`User Information`:** Profiles of buyers and sellers.
- **`Product Listings`:** Comprehensive data on items available for sale.
- **`Inventory Management`:** Tracking and control of product availability.
- **`Order Tracking`:** ecording the status of orders placed by buyers.
- **`Transaction Data`:**  Records of transactions using transaction id.

## Key Components

- **`Database`:** PostgreSQL
- **`Entity Relationship Model`:** Visual representation of our database structure.
- **`Relational Model`:** Detailed schema design derived from our entity-relationship model.
- **`Functional Dependencies`:** Defined relationships between attributes.
- **`Normalization (BCNF)`:** Ensuring data integrity through rigorous normalization.
- **`PostgreSQL DDL Schema Implementation`:** Scripts for creating tables and defining relationships.
- **`PostgreSQL DML Data Insertion`:** Scripts for populating the database with sample data.
- **`SQL Sample Queries`:** Examples of queries for data retrieval and manipulation.

## Future Enhancements

In the future, we plan to enhance the system with:
- Customize data views for different user roles to provide tailored access.
- A user-friendly web interface for easier navigation and interaction with the database.
